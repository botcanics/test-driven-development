## Test-Driven Software Development 

The Test-Driven Development *Codeprimate* project and source repository is a collection of Java modules and classes 
along with the *'Test-Driven Software Development.pdf'* file discussing and demonstrating *Test-Driven Development* (TDD)
in practice.

#### Agenda

1. Misconceptions
2. Why Test
3. Types of Tests
4. What & How-To Test
5. Using **JUnit**, **Mockito** and **MulithreadedTC**
6. Best Practices
7. Final Thoughts
8. QA

#### Highlights

> “No amount of testing can prove a software right, but a single test can prove a software wrong.” – Amir Ghahrai

> "Not everything that can be counted counts and not everything that counts can be counted." - Albert Einstein

There is **“good code”** and then there is **“tested code”**.
